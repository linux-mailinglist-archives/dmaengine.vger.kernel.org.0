OK.

Unfortunately it is.
Each channel can be configured to Packet or TR mode. For some
peripherals it is true that they only support packet mode, these are the
newer PSI-L native peripherals.
For these channels a udma-mode property would be correct.

But we have legacy peripherals as well and they are serviced by PDMA
(which is a native peripheral designed to talk to the given legacy IP).
We can use either packet or TR mode in UDMAP to talk to PDMAs, it is in
most cases clear what to use, but for example for audio (McASP) channels
Linux is using TR channel because we need cyclic DMA while for example
RTOS is using Packet mode as it fits their needs better.

Here I need to prefix the udma-mode with linux as the mode is used by
Linux, but other OS might opt to use different channel mode.

The reason why this needs to be in the DT is that when the channel is
requested we need to configure the mode and it can not be swapped
runtime easily between Packet and TR mode.

Sure, I'll extend the example with other peripheral which uses more
properties.

The reason I have used define to build the psil-config sections is that
we have some PDMAs with 22 threads and it makes the DT explode when
writing out all of the thread configurations.

Within one PDMA we can have a mix of different modes, so I can not say
that all of the threads in the PDMA is the same.
