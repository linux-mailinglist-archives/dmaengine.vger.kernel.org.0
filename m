Ah, I didn't know the names were already decided.

However, I still think we should at least separate the patch into two in 
the same series, one adding the bus node and handling existing nodes, 
and another adding the new node under it. This way, say someone starts 
working on Crypto, they can simply depends on the first bus patch 
without having to pull in the new node.

I still prefer having a canonical buses patch though.

If we're going to agree here on what the buses should look, I also have 
two nitpicks, just so we get this sorted: Firstly, I think storage_bus 
should be removed. Anything using storage_bus is already handled by 
simply using 32-bit-only DMA, which is the default anyway. @Ze Huang: 
Your USB controller falls under it, what do you think?

Also, as suggested the node names must not have a made up unit address. 
"bus@1" is inappropriate because they have no reg. The simple-bus schema 
allows the node name to have a prefix like "foo-bus" [1] [2], so it 
should be like:

/* DMA controller, and users */
dma_bus: dma-bus {
	compatible = "simple-bus";
	ranges;
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <2>;
	dma-ranges = <0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x80000000>,
		     <0x1 0x00000000 0x1 0x80000000 0x3 0x00000000>;
};

(Pardon the formatting; I don't know if the tabs survived Thunderbird.)

Well, that is the reason I wanted the bus things to be its own patch: I 
think the DT maintainers should review these once and for all, not six 
separate times as the drivers come in.

I hope we can agree on what the bus nodes look like before we do that 
separately.

I hope so as well, but "we" here should include DT maintainers.

Please consider my suggestions.
