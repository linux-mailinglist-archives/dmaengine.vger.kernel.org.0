The hardware checks that the PASID in the descriptor matches the PASID in the 
IMS entry, to prevent user-mode software from arbitrarily choosing any interrupt 
vector it wants. User mode software has to request an IMS entry from the kernel 
driver and the driver fills in the PASID in the IMS so that only that process 
can use that IMS entry.
