wrapping the cbass_main_navss inside:
cbass_main {
    #address-cells = <2>;
    #size-cells = <2>;
    ...
};

fixes it.

I took the navss node from the upstream dts (I'm going to fix it there
as well).
It has simple-bus for the navss, which is not quite right as NAVSS is
not a bus, but a big subsystem with multiple components (UDMAP, ringacc,
INTA, INTR, timers, etc).

What about to change the binding doc to simple-mfd like this

cbass_main_navss: navss@30800000 {
    compatible = "simple-mfd";
    #address-cells = <2>;
    #size-cells = <2>;
    ...
};

and fix up the DT when I got to the point when I can send the patches to
enable DMA for am654 and j721e?

Like this:
  compatible:
    oneOf:
      - description: for AM654
        items:
          - enum:
              - ti,am654-navss-main-udmap
              - ti,am654-navss-mcu-udmap

      - description: for J721E
        items:
          - enum:
              - ti,j721e-navss-main-udmap
              - ti,j721e-navss-mcu-udmap

The subtype is usually smaller than 30 for the current K3 device
line-up, but I would not set an upper limit, it all depends on system
firmware for the given family member.

I'll drop the items for the rm-ranges
