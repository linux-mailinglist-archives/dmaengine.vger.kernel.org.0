Approach to IMS is more of a phased approach. 

#1 Allow physical device to scale beyond limits of PCIe MSIx
   Follows current methodology for guest interrupt programming and
   evolutionary changes rather than drastic.
#2 Long term we should work together on enabling IMS in guest which
   requires changes in both HW and SW eco-system.

For #1, the immediate need is to find a way to limit guest from using IMS
due to current limitations. We have couple options.

a) CPUID based method to disallow IMS when running in a guest OS. Limiting
   use to existing virtual MSIx to guest devices. (Both you/Jason alluded)
b) We can extend DMAR table to have a flag for opt-out. So in real platform
   this flag is clear and in guest VMM will ensure vDMAR will have this flag
   set. Along the lines as Jason alluded, platform level and via ACPI
   methods. We have similar use for x2apic_optout today.

Think a) is probably more generic.

For #2 Long term goal of allowing IMS in guest for devices that require
them. This requires some extensive eco-system enabling. 

- Extending HW to understand PASID-tagged interrupt messages.
- Appropriate extensions to IOMMU to enforce such PASID based isolation.

From SW improvements:

- Hypercall to retrieve addr/data from host
- Ensure SW can provide guarantee that the interrupt address range will not
  be mapped in process space when SVM is in play. Otherwise its hard to
  distinguish between DMA and Interrupt. OS needs to opt-in to this
  behavior. Today we ensure IOVA space has this 0xFEExxxxx range carve out
  of the IOVA space.


Devices such as idxd that do not have these entries on page-boundaries for
isolation to permit direct programming from GuestOS will continue to use
trap-emulate as used today.

In the end, virtualizing IMS requires eco-system collaboration, and we are
very open to change hw when all the relevant pieces are in place.

Until then, IMS will be restricted to host VMM only, and we can use the
methods above to prevent IMS in guest and continue to use the legacy
virtual MSIx.

Today this is true for all interrupt types, MSI/MSIx/IMS.

No comment on the adjectives above :-)

IMS doesn't restrict this optimization, but to allow it requires more OS support as
you had mentioned.

Current IMS support adds incremental feature capability. Works pretty much
following everything that was created for MSIx, but just adds some device
flexibility. 

Here are some reasons why PASID isn't used today for tagging interrupts.

Interrupt messages (as specified by MSI/MSI-X in PCI specification) are 
currently defined as DWORD DMA writes to a platform/architecture specific 
address (0xFEExxxxx on Intel platforms). Existing root-complexes detect
DWORD writes to 0xFEExxxxx (without a PASID in the transaction) as interrupt 
messages and route them to interrupt-remapping logic (as opposed to other 
DMA requests that are routed to IOMMU's DMA remapping logic). 

There are multiple tools (such as logic analyzers) and OEM test validation 
harnesses that depend on such DWORD sized DMA writes with no PASID as interrupt
messages. One of the feedback we had received in the development of the
specification was to avoid impacting such tools irrespective of MSI-X or IMS 
was used for interrupt message storage (on the wire they follow the same format), 
and also to ensure interoperability of devices supporting IMS across CPU vendors 
(who may not support PASID TLP prefix).  This is one reason that led to interrupts 
from IMS to not use PASID (and match the wire format of MSI/MSI-X generated interrupts). 
The other problem was disambiguation between DMA to SVM v/s interrupts.

Intel had published the specification almost 2 years back and have
comprehended all the feedback received from the ecosystem 
(both open-source and others), along with offering the specification 
to be implemented by any vendors (both device and CPU vendors). 
There are few device vendors who are implementing to the spec already and 
are being explored for support by other CPU vendors
