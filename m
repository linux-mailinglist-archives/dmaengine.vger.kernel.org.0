The ringacc is a build and runtime dependency for the DMA. I have hoped
that all of them can go via DMAengine (hence asking for your ACK on the
drivers/soc/ti/ patches) for 5.6.

> Can you please do that?

This late in the merge window that would really mean that I will miss
another release for the KS3 DMA...
I can live with that if you can pick the ringacc for 5.6 and if Vinod
takes the DMAengine core changes as well.

That would leave only the DMA drivers for 5.7 and we can also queue up
changes for 5.7 which depends on the DMAengine API (ASoC changes, UART,
sa2ul, etc).

If they go independently and nothing makes it to 5.6 then 5.8 is the
realistic target for the DMA support for the KS3 family of devices...
