I'm sure everybody dislikes (hate being a strong word :-)). 
DVSEC capability. Real hardware always sets it to 1 for the IMS capability.

By default the DVSEC is not presented to guest even when the full PF is
presented to guest. I believe VFIO only builds and presents known standard
capabilities and specific extended capabilities. I'm a bit weak but maybe
@AlexWilliamson can confirm if I'm off track.

This tells the driver in guest that IMS is not available and will not
create those new dev_msi calls. 

Only if the VMM has build support to expose IMS for this device, guest SW
can even see DVSEC.SIOV.IMS=1. This also means the required plumbing, say
vIOMMU, or a hypercall has been provisioned, and adminstrator knows the
guest is compatible for these options. 

There maybe better ways to do this. If this has to be done differently
we certainly can and will do.

How would we opt-in when the feature is not available? You need someway to
tell the capability is available in the guest?, but then there is no reason
to opt-in though.. its ready for use isn't it?

The only closest thing that comes to mind is the CPUID bits, you had
mentioned they aren't reliable if the VMM didn't set those in an earlier
mail. If you want a platform level generic support.

- DMAR table optout's you had mentioned that's ugly
- We could use caching mode, but its not a platform level thing, and vendor
  specific. I'm not sure if other vendors have a similar feature. If there
  is a generic capabilty, we could expose via the iommu api's if we are in
  virt or real platform.

We can pick how to solve this, and just waiting for you to tell, what
mechanism you prefer that's less painful and architecturally acceptible for
virtualization and linux. We are all ears!
