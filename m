I have thought about this, we should be able to drop the phandle to the
dma controller from the slave binding just fine.

However we have the dma routers for the slave channels and there is no
clear way to handle them.
They are not needed for non slave channels as there is no trigger to
route. In DRA7 for example we have an event router for EDMA and another
one for sDMA. If a slave device is to be serviced by EDMA, the EDMA
event router needs to be specified, for sDMA clients should use the sDMA
event router.
In DRA7 case we don't really have DMA controllers for domains, but we
use the DMA which can service the peripheral better (sDMA is better to
be used for UART, but can not be used for McASP for example)

Then we have the other type of DMA router for daVinci/am33xx/am43xx
where the crossbar is not for the whole EDMA controller like in DRA7,
but we have small crossbars for some channels.

Other vendors have their own dma router topology..

Too many variables to handle the cases without gotchas, which would need
heavy churn in the core or in drivers.
