hmmm, so maybe we call it something else or just say dynamic platform-msi?

Well, I got a lot of comments internally and externally about how the 
cover page needs to have just the basics and all the ugly details can go 
in the Documentation. So well, I am confused here.

So I think conceptually, there is no difference between platform-msi and 
IMS. (Just thinking out loud).

 From a code stand-point, currently
1. Allocation of interrupts is static. I don't think the 
platform-msi-domain_alloc_irqs can be called multiple times.
2. only a write-msg callback is present and they use the parent IRQ 
chip's mask/unmask functions
3. IMS needs interrupt remapping support to be enabled (this is 
independent of the above 2).

If 1 and 2 is all that you are looking for, then we can split the code 
such that we have a generic platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs_dyn, which 
will be used for the dynamic allocation of IRQs and another 
platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs_ims (or whatever the name IMS will boil 
down to) which will use interrupt remapping support to get the IRQ 
domain etc.

yup!

well, in this case, ims_ops, ims_mask etc are just example names.
