we are using port name for
1. compare with name and and enable port configurations dynamically when 
it is enabled from devicetree.
2. for debug purpose.

I think you are reffering to 'dma-channels' property. This represents 
Number of DMA channels supported by the controller.

intel,chans attribute represents channels starting number and number of 
channels in this port.
intel,chans = <channel starting number, number of channels in this port>

ok.
If we move these attributes to dmas, we need to configure these 
dynamically from driver side when client request for channel.

Both port and channel mapping is needed for dma slave configuration and 
also the available channels reading from device-tree dynamically instead 
of reading from registers.
So port & channel id's and descriptor information will keep in the child 
nodes and other attributes like burst, txwgt will move to 'dmas'.
