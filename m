Yeah most of what you said is right. For the most part, we are simply introducing a new IRQ domain
which provides specific domain info ops for the classes of devices which want to provide custom
mask/unmask callbacks..

Also, from your other comments, I've realized the same IRQ domain can be used when interrupt
remapping is enabled/disabled.

Hence we will only have one create_dev_msi_domain which can be called by any device driver that
wants to use the dev-msi IRQ domain to alloc/free IRQs. It would be the responsibility of the device
driver to provide the correct device and update the dev->msi_domain.

I don't think I understand this fully, ive still kept the device specific mask/unmask calls in the next
patch series, please let me know if it needs further modifications.
