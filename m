Right, but it gives me only half the information I need to be a link useful.
I know that device X is using two channels but I need to check the
device X's directory to know which channel is used for what purpose.

More like /sys/kernel/debug/gpio

Sure, but only when the file is read.
You can add
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
#endif

around the slave_device and name in struct dma_chan {}

and when user reads the file you print out something like this:
cat /sys/kernel/debug/dmaengine

e6700000.dma-controller:
dma0chan0		e6e20000.spi:tx
dma0chan1		e6e20000.spi:rx
dma0chan2		ee100000.sd:tx
dma0chan3		ee100000.sd:rx
...
dma0chan14		non slave
...

e6720000.dma-controller:
dma1chan0		e6b10000.spi:tx
dma1chan1		e6b10000.spi:rx
...

This way we will have all the information in one place, easy to look up
and you don't need to manage symlinks dynamically, just check all
channels if they have slave_device/name when they are in_use (in_use w/o
slave_device is 'non slave')

Some drivers are requesting and releasing the DMA channel per transfer
or when they are opened/closed or other variations.
