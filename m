Hi Jason

Thanks, its now clear what you had mentioned earlier.

I had couple questions/clarifications below. Thanks for working 
through this.

Is it really some fake thing? I thought the vCPU and vector are real
for a guest, and VMM ensures when interrupts are delivered they are either.

1. Handled by VMM first and then injected to guest
2. Handled in a Posted Interrupt manner, and injected to guest
   when it resumes. It can be delivered directly if guest was running
   when the interrupt arrived.

So is that true for interrupts too? Possibly you have the interrupt
entries sitting in memory resident on the device? Don't we need the 
VMM to ensure they are brokered by VMM in either one of the two ways 
above? What if the guest creates some addr in the 0xfee... range
how do we take care of interrupt remapping and such without any VMM 
assist?

Its probably a gap in my understanding.

That's true. Probably this can work the same even for MSIx types too then?

When we do interrupt remapping support in guest which would be required 
if we support x2apic in guest, I think this is something we should look into more 
carefully to make this work.

One criteria that we generally tried to follow is driver that runs in host
and guest are the same, and if needed they need some functionality make it
work around some capability  detection so the alternate path can be plummed in
a generic way. 

I agree with the overall idea and we should certainly take that into consideration
when we need IMS in guest support and in context of interrupt remapping.

Hopefully I understood the overall concept. If I mis-understood any of this
please let me know.

Cheers,
Ashok
