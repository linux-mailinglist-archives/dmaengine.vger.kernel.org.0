Maybe I'm looking at this wrong. I see a some code in vfio_pci_intrs.c 
that we can reuse with some changes here and there. But, I think see 
where you are getting at with just common functions for mdev side. Let 
me create it just for IMS emulation and then we can go from there trying 
to figure if that's the right path to go down or if we need to share 
code with vfio_pci.
