Are you referring to calling mdev_device_create() directly in the mdev 
idxd_driver probe? I think this would work with our dedicated wq where a 
single mdev can be assigned to a wq. However, later on when we need to 
support shared wq where we can create multiple mdev per wq, we'll need 
an entry point to do so. In the name of making things consistent from 
user perspective, going through sysfs seems the way to do it.
