[ Upstream commit e8ee6c8cb61b676f1a2d6b942329e98224bd8ee9 ]

DW DMA IP-core provides a way to synthesize the DMA controller with
channels having different parameters like maximum burst-length,
multi-block support, maximum data width, etc. Those parameters both
explicitly and implicitly affect the channels performance. Since DMA slave
devices might be very demanding to the DMA performance, let's provide a
functionality for the slaves to be assigned with DW DMA channels, which
performance according to the platform engineer fulfill their requirements.
After this patch is applied it can be done by passing the mask of suitable
DMA-channels either directly in the dw_dma_slave structure instance or as
a fifth cell of the DMA DT-property. If mask is zero or not provided, then
there is no limitation on the channels allocation.

For instance Baikal-T1 SoC is equipped with a DW DMAC engine, which first
two channels are synthesized with max burst length of 16, while the rest
of the channels have been created with max-burst-len=4. It would seem that
the first two channels must be faster than the others and should be more
preferable for the time-critical DMA slave devices. In practice it turned
out that the situation is quite the opposite. The channels with
max-burst-len=4 demonstrated a better performance than the channels with
max-burst-len=16 even when they both had been initialized with the same
settings. The performance drop of the first two DMA-channels made them
unsuitable for the DW APB SSI slave device. No matter what settings they
are configured with, full-duplex SPI transfers occasionally experience the
Rx FIFO overflow. It means that the DMA-engine doesn't keep up with
incoming data pace even though the SPI-bus is enabled with speed of 25MHz
while the DW DMA controller is clocked with 50MHz signal. There is no such
problem has been noticed for the channels synthesized with
max-burst-len=4.
