Ok, we/I need a terminology clarification, a BAR is a register in
config space for determining the size, type, and setting the location
of a I/O or memory region of a device.  I've been asserting that the
emulation of the BAR itself is trivial, but are you actually focused on
emulation of the region described by the BAR?  This is what mdev is
for, mediating access to a device and filling in gaps such that we can
use re-use the vfio device APIs.

Maybe what you're recalling me say about mdev is that its Achilles
heel is that we rely on mediation provider (ie. vendor driver) for
security, we don't necessarily have an piece of known, common hardware
like an IOMMU to protect us when things go wrong.  That's true, but
don't we also trust drivers in the host kernel to correctly manage and
validate their own interactions with hardware, including the APIs
provided through other user interfaces.  Is the assertion then that
device specific, register level API is too difficult to emulate?

Well, in order to mediate a device, we certainly expect there to be a
physical device.  I also expect that there's some performance or at
least compatibility advantage to using the device API directly rather
than masquerading everything behind something like virtio.  So no, I
wouldn't expect someone to create a fully emulated device in mdev, but
also I do expect some degree of device emulation in an mdev driver to
fill the gaps in non-performance path that hardware chose to defer to
software.  Thanks,

Alex
