You certainly don't want to have a MMIO read at each iteration of the
loop, as that would be quite a bit of overhead. I'm not sure it's worth
it to try to minimize the channel re-enable latency. You are only
getting into this situation because of bad system latencies before this
part of the code run, so the little bit of latency added by cleaning
the descriptors before trying to re-enable the channel will probably
not add much further harm and you don't risk running in the out-of-
descriptors error immediately again. Remember, in a preemptible kernel
the task cleaning the descriptors could be put to sleep immediately
after you you cleaned a single descriptor and kicked the channel back
to life.

In fact the writel_relaxed needs to be replaced by the non-relaxed
version to imply a proper memory barrier before the register write.
