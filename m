Let's see the two cases, AT_END_OF_TRANSFER and ABORT_IMMEDIATELY
against cyclic and slave for simplicity:
- AT_END_OF_TRANSFER
...
issue_pending(1)
issue_pending(2)
terminate_cookie(AT_END_OF_TRANSFER)

In case of cyclic:
When cookie1 finishes a tx cookie2 will start.

Same sequence in case of slave:
When cookie1 finishes a tx cookie2 will start.
 Yes, terminate_cookie(AT_END_OF_TRANSFER) is NOP

- ABORT_IMMEDIATELY
...
issue_pending(1)
issue_pending(2)
terminate_cookie(ABORT_IMMEDIATELY)

In case of cyclic and slave:
Abort cookie1 right away and start cookie2.

In case of cyclic:
When cookie1 finishes a tx cookie2 will start.

True, we have NOP operation, but as you can see the semantics of the two
cases are well defined and consistent among different operations.

Imho the only thing which is not really defined is the
AT_END_OF_TRANSFER, is it after the current period, or when finishing
the buffer / after a frame or all frames are consumed in the current tx
for interleaved.

All TI DMA supports it ;)
