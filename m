The MSI side of affairs has nothing to do with Intel and neither with
ACPIv1. It's a trainwreck on the PCI side.

MSI interrupts do not have mandatory masking. For those which do not
implement it (and that's still the case with devices designed today
especially CPU internal peripherals) there are only a few options to
shut them up:

  1) Disable MSI which has the problem that the interrupt gets
     redirected to legacy PCI #A-#D interrupt unless the hardware
     supports to disable that redirection, which is another optional
     thing and hopeless case

  2) Disable it at the IRQ remapping level which fortunately allows by
     design to do so.

  3) Disable it at the device level which is feasible for a device
     driver but impossible for the irq side

Yes, it's a pain, but reality.

See above. You cannot reach out to the device driver to disable the
underlying interrupt source, which is the ultimate ratio if #1 or #2 are
not working or not there. That would be squaring the circle and
violating all rules of layering and locking at once.

The bad news is that we can't change the hardware. We have to deal with
it. And yes, I told HW people publicly and in private conversations that
unmaskable interrupts are broken by definition for more than a
decade. They still get designed that way ...

Which semantics? The horrors of MSI or the halfways reasonable MSI-X
variant?
