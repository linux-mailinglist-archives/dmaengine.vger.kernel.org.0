Basically what I am trying to do here is to determine if the device is 
an mdev device or not. mdev devices have no IRQ domain associated to it 
and use their parent dev's IRQ domain to allocate interrupts.

The issue is that
1. all the vfio-mdev code today can be compiled as a module
2. None of the mdev macros/functions are being used outside of the 
drivers/vfio/mdev code path (where they are defined).

Hence, these definitions are not visible outside of drivers/vfio/mdev 
when compiled as a module and thus I have used symbol_get/put.

I will try asking the mdev folks if they would have a better solution 
for this or some of this code can be mde more generic.

In our current use case, IMS interrupts are only used by guest (mdev's), 
although they can be used by host as well. So the 'dev' passed by the 
caller of platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs_group() is effectively an mdev.

I am not sure about how we could have a generic code to convert the 
'child' mdev device to struct device. Do you have any suggestions on how 
we could do this?

Well, this needs to go for sure. I will replace it with something more 
generic.

It is just a way to create a new domain specifically for IMS interrupts. 
Although, since there is a platform_msi_create_irq_domain already, which 
does something similar, I will use the same for IMS as well.

Also, since there is quite a stir over the name 'IMS' do you have any 
suggestion for a more generic name for this?

As I mentioned earlier, given the way the current mdev code is 
structured, the only way to use dev_is_mdev or other macros/functions in 
the mdev subsystem outside of drivers/vfio/mdev is to use 
symbol_get/put. Obviously, seems like this is not a correct thing to do, 
I will have to find another way.
