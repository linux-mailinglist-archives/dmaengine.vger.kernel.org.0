So after some internal discussions, we have concluded that IMS has no 
linkage with Interrupt remapping, IR is just a platform concept. IMS is 
just a name Intel came up with, all it really means is device managed 
addr/data writes to generate interrupts. Technically we can call 
something IMS even if device has its own location to store interrupts in 
non-pci standard mechanism, much like platform-msi indeed. We simply 
need to extend platform-msi to its address some of its shortcomings: 
increase number of interrupts to > 2048, enable dynamic allocation of 
interrupts, add mask/unmask callbacks in addition to write_msg etc.
FWIW, even MSI can be IMS with rules on how to manage the addr/data 
writes following pci sig .. its just that.

I will be sending out an email shortly outlining the new design for IMS 
(A.K.A platform-msi part 2) and what are the improvements we want to add 
to the already existing platform-msi infrastructure.

Thank you so much for your comments, it helped us iron out some of these 
details :)
