I'm not sure why we need to call this IMS in kernel documentat? I know
Intel is using this term, but this document is really only talking
about extending the existing platform_msi stuff, which looks pretty
good actually.

A lot of this is good for the cover letter..

How exactly is an IMS interrupt is different from a platform msi?

It looks like it is just some thin wrapper around msi_domain - what is
it for?

FWIW, I agree with this.

Like platform-msi, IMS should be controlled entirely by the driver.

Generally agree

Need much more closer look, but this seems conceptually fine to me.

As above the API here is called platform_msi - which seems good to
me. Again not sure why the word IMS is needed
