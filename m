So drawing that parallel, do you expect all drivers that call
pci_register_driver() to be located in drivers/pci? Aren't they scattered
all over the place ata,scsi, platform drivers and such?

As Alex pointed out, i915 and handful of s390 drivers that are mdev users
are not in drivers/vfio. Are you sayint those drivers don't get reviewed? 

This is no different than PF driver offering VF services. Its a logical
extension. 

Reviews happen for mdev users today. What you suggest seems like cutting 
the feet to fit the shoe. Unless the maintainers are asking things 
to be split just because its calling mdev_register_device() that practice 
doesn't exist and would be totally weird if you want to move all callers of
pci_register_driver(). 

Your argument seems interesting even entertaining :-). But honestly i'm not finding it
practical :-). So every caller of mmu_register_notifier() needs to be in
mm? 

What you mention for different functions make absolute sense, not arguing
against that.  but this ain't that. 

And we just follow the asks of the maintainer. 

I know you aren't going to give up, but there is little we can do. I want
the maintainers to make that call and I'm not add more noise to this.

Cheers,
Ashok
