Yes, that's correct.

at alloc / xlate time the DMA driver does not have information about
router. The alloc/xlate will result the channel, but in my case it will
result a broken setup as the router does not know which event to send.

When I added the DMA event router support, it was designed in a way that
the DMA driver itself must not know anything about the router, it has to
be transparent. One can just add a router on front of any DMA and
everything will work.
This is the right thing to do, and it works for existing setups.

The BCDMA triggered channel setup is a chicken-egg setup.
For this case the channel can be triggered by a global event. A channel
can receive two global event, but this is not a concern atm.
The event number depends on the channel we use, for simplicity let's
say: bchan_id + trigger_offset = bchan_trigger_evt.

of_dma_router_xlate does this:

1. calls the dma router's of_dma_route_allocate callback to allocate a
route and craft a dma_spec for the DMA to configure a channel.

2. using this crafted dma_spec we request a channel via of_dma_xlate
callback

3. if we got the channel, we save the router information, so it can be
deallocated when the channel is disabled.

I need a fourth step to do a final configuration since only at this time
(after it has been allocated) the channel has information about possible
router.

In the new optional callback the DMA driver can figure out the event
number which must be used by the router to send the event to the desired
global event target of the channel.

Other DMAs might need something different, but imho if there is going to
be a need for such post alloc router config, then it is most likely will
come from the need to feed back some sort of channel information to the
router. Or take parameter from the router itself for the channel.

To summarize:
In of_dma_route_allocate() the router does not yet know the channel we
are going to get.
In of_dma_xlate() the DMA driver does not yet know if the channel will
use router or not.
I need to tell the router the event number it has to send, which is
based on the channel number I got.
