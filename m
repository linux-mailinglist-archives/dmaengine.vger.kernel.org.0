I Need Urgent Respond,

Please do not feel disturbed for contacting you, My Name is Mrs
Elliana Gupta , Am 58 years and I am contacting you from my country
Tunisia. I married to Mr. james Gupta who worked with Tunisia embassy
in Burkina Faso for nine years before he died in the year 2015.We were
married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for some days. Since his death I decided not to
remarry, When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of USD $
850.000 (Eight hundred And fifty Thousand Dollars) in a bank Presently
this money is still in bank.

Recently, My Doctor told me that I would not last for the period of
time due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke
sickness. Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this
money to take care of the less-privileged people Orphanages, because I
don't want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I grew
up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member, Am doing
this so that God will forgive my sins and accept my soul because these
sicknesses have suffered me so much. If you can handle this proposal
successfully i am ready to give you 30 Percent of the total fund for
your personal use While 70% of the fund will go to charity work, and
helping the Orhanage. I wait your reply For More Details contact my
email below (misselina201@gmail.com)

Best Regards,
From Mrs Elliana
