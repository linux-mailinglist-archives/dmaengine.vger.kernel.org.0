No, this is not the original issue and we never actually had a 
discussion. That original issue was about using Set/ClearPageReserved. 
You nor Robin even tried to explain why it was wrong to use it. It was 
never an issue in previous kernels. Why now? In any case I have removed 
that code. This is what happens now.

What is it you think I am doing wrong. Except for using 
Set/ClearPageReserved you have not explained anything to me.
