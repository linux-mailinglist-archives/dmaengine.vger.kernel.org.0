Greetings My Dear,

I sent this mail praying it will found you in a good condition of
health, since I myself are in a very critical health condition in
which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the
next day. I am Mrs.Elisabeth John a widow suffering from long time
illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum
of ($11,000,000.00, Eleven Million Dollars) my Doctor told me recently
that I have serious sickness which is cancer problem. What disturbs me
most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to
donate this fund to a good person that will utilize it the way i am
going to instruct herein. I need a very honest and God.

fearing person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works,
for orphanages, widows and also build schools for less privileges that
will be named after my late husband if possible and to promote the
word of God and the effort that the house of God is maintained. I do
not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. That's why I'm taking this decision. I'm not afraid of death
so I know where I'm going. I accept this decision because I do not
have any child who will inherit this money after I die. Please I want
your sincerely and urgent answer to know if you will be able to
execute this project, and I will give you more information on how the
fund will be transferred to your bank account. I am waiting for your
reply.

May God Bless you,
Mrs.Elisabeth John.
