Hello there,

I am Laghouili Abdellatif. I am contacting you because I have a=20
proposal that I think may be interested in. I represent the=20
interest of my brother in-law who was a minister in the Syrian=20
Government. As you probably know, there is a lot of crisis going=20
on currently in Syria and my brother in-law has fallen out with=20
the ruling Junta and the president because of his foreign=20
policies and the senseless war and killings that has been going=20
on for a while. Everybody in Syria is fed up and want a change=20
but the president is too powerfull and he simply kills anyone=20
that tries to oppose him. My brother in-law belives that he is at=20
risk and he is now very scared for the safety of his family=20
especially his kids. In order to ensure that his family is taken=20
care of and protected incase anything happens to him, he has=20
asked me to help him find a foreign investor who can help him=20
accommodate and invest 100 MUSD privately that he has secured in=20
Europe. He wants these funds safely invested so that the future=20
and safety of his family can be secured.

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be interested in=20
helping us. We need your help to accommodate the funds in the=20
banking system in your country and also invest it in a lucrative=20
projects that will yeild good profits. We will handle all the=20
logistics involved in the movement of the funds to you. The funds=20
is already in Europe so you have nothing to worry about because=20
this transaction will be executed in a legal way. My brother in-
law has also promised to compensate you for your help. He wants=20
this to be done discretely so I will be acting as his eyes and=20
ears during the course of this transaction.

If this proposal interests you, please kindly respond so that I=20
can give you more details.

Regards,

Laghouili.
