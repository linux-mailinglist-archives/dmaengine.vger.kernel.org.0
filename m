Hmm yeah exactly, since they are virtual, they do not have an associated 
IRQ domain right? So they use the irq domain of the parent device..

hmmm do you mean to say all platform-msi adhere to the rules of a PCI 
device? The use case if when we have a device assigned to a guest and we 
want to allocate IMS(platform-msi) interrupts for that guest-assigned 
device. Currently, this is abstracted through a mdev interface.

yeah this code will not exist in the next version anyways..

yeah, ultimately IMS boils down to "Extended platform_msi" looks like ..
