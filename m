Yes, but that's just how it's done today and there is no real need to do
so.

That's not the problem at all. The VMM is not responsible for the
correctness of the guest OS at all. All the VMM cares about is that the
guest cannot access anything which does not belong to the guest.

If the guest OS screws up the message (by stupidity or malice), then the
MSI sent from the passed through device has to be caught by the
IOMMU/remap unit if an _only_ if it writes to something which it is not
allowed to.

If it overwrites the guests memory then so be it. The VMM cannot prevent
the guest OS doing so by a stray pointer either. So why would it worry
about the MSI going into guest owned lala land?

PASID is irrelevant here.

If the device sends a message then the remap unit will see the requester
ID of the device and if the message it sends is not matching the remap
tables then it's caught and the guest is terminated. At least that's how
it should be.

Again, trap emulate does not work for IMS when the IMS store is software
managed guest memory and not part of the device. And that's the whole
reason why we are discussing this.
