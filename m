Hrm, yes all list operation against desc_* should be protected by the
lock, it is a miss.

Right.
I think the most elegant way to fix this would be to introduce a new
list_head in virt_dma_chan, let's name it desc_terminated.

We would add the descriptor to this within vchan_terminate_vdesc() (lock
is held).
In vchan_synchronize() we would
list_splice_tail_init(&vc->desc_terminated, &head);
with the lock held and outside of the lock we free them up.

So we would put the terminated descs to the new list and free them up in
synchronize.

This way the vchan_vdesc_fini() would be only called without the lock held.

In the in review k3-udma driver I use dma_pool or dma_alloc_coherent in
mixed mode depending on the type of the channel.

I did also see the same issue and what I ended up doing is to have
desc_to_purge list and udma_purge_desc_work()
in udma_desc_free() if the descriptor is from the dma_pool, I free it
right away, if it needs dma_free_coherent() then I put it to the
desc_to_purge list and schedule the purge worker to deal with them at a
later time.

In this driver I don't use vchan_terminate_vdesc() because of this.

I think it should be called without the lock held.
