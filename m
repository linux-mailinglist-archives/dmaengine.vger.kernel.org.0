Ok sure. But looks like we need to come up with a way to not break your usages.

Thoughts on introducing per channel cap mask in addition to the existing per 
device mask? Sounds like we already have devices with some channels having 
different capabilities and may expand with future devices. This way we can do 
this on a per channel basis?
