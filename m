Not sure what you mean by 'driver patches'...
The series to enable DMA support on TI's K3 platform consists:
Patch 1-2: Ring Accelerator _driver_ (drivers/soc/ti/)
Patch 3-6: DMAengine core patches to add new features needed for k3-udma
Patch 7-11: DMA _driver_ patches for K3 (drivers/dma/ti/)

Patch 10 depends on the ringacc and the DMAengine core patches
Patch 11 depends on patch 10

I kept it as a single series in hope that they will go via one subsystem
tree to avoid build dependency issues and will have a good amount of
time in linux-next for testing.

OK, I'll send the two patch for ringacc as a separate series.

Vinod: Would it be possible for you to pick up the DMAengine core
patches (patch 3-6)?
The UDMA driver patches have hard dependency on DMAengine core and
ringacc, not sure how they are going to go in...
