_if_ the dma_request_slave_channel_compat() is really falling back after
dma_request_chan() - this is what it calls first, then it is not a
simple convert to a new API.
1. The arch needs to define the dma_slave_map for the SoC.
2. The dma driver needs few lines to add it to DMAengine core (+pdata
change).
After this the _compat() can be replaced with dma_request_chan()

In most cases I do not have access to documentation and boards to test.

Looking at the output of 'git grep dma_request_slave_channel_compat':
drivers/mmc/host/renesas_sdhi_sys_dmac.c
drivers/spi/spi-pxa2xx-dma.c
drivers/spi/spi-rspi.c
drivers/spi/spi-sh-msiof.c
drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_dma.c

From these rspi boots only in DT and I'm not sure about the others.
8250_dma is a tricky one as it is used as generic DMA layer for many arch.

Sure, but before you accuse anyone with neglect, can you check the git
log for 'dma_request_slave_channel' in the commit messages?

The _compat() can not be removed, but we just don't know who really
needs the fallback after dma_request_chan().
With the print the hope is that users will come forward and we can help
migrate or address their specific needs.

I'm fine to drop the pr_info() and the __deprecated mark for
dma_request_slave_channel.

To touch the _compat() variant one needs to have access to the
documentation of the SoC on which the code falls back. It is not a
matter of sloppy/poor/ignorant/etc work attitude.
I have kept clear on touching those few drivers using it [1] as I don't
have documentation.

Sure, but we rarely CCd on new client drivers for DMAengine API usage.

[1] fwiw, there are drivers using dma_request_channel() and by the look
their use is either _compat() or the dma_request_chan_by_mask() style
and some even have a twist here and there...
