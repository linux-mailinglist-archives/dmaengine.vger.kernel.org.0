That has not been explained to me at all. I am NOT any longer using 
virt_to_page at all anywhere in the driver. I was told that 
Set/ClearPageReserve was what I was doing wrong. Not that I was using 
virt_to_page with it. I am not using either now. I am using only 
dma_alloc_coherent.

I am not trying to bother you and there is no reason for you to be rude 
to me. I just think this is a bug and am trying to get to the bottom of it.
