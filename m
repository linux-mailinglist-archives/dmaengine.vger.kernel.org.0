Thomas,

With all these interrupt message storms ;-), I'm missing how to move towards
an end goal.

It would greatly help if you can put down what you see is blocking 
to move forward in the following areas.

Address Gaps in Spec: 

Specs can accomodate change after review, as the number of ECN's that go on
with PCIe ;-). Please add what you like to see in the spec if you beleive
is a gap today.

Hardware Gaps?
- PASID tagged Interrupts.
- IOMMU Support for PASID based IR.

As i had called out, there are a lot of moving parts, and requires more
attention.

OS Gaps?
- Lack of ability to identify if platform can use IMS.
- Lack of hypercall.

We will always have devices that have more interrupts but their use doesn't
need IMS to be directly manipulated by the guest, or the fact those usages
require more than what is allowed by PCIe in a guest. These devices can 
scale by adding another sub-device and you get another block of 2048 if needed.

This isn't just for idxd, as I mentioned earlier, there are vendors other
than Intel already working on this. In all cases the need for guest direct
manipulation of interrupt store hasn't come up. From the discussion, it
seems like there are devices today or in future that will require direct
manipulation of interrupt store in the guest. This needs additional work
in both the device hardware providing the right plumbing and OS work to
comprehend those.

Cheers,
Ashok
