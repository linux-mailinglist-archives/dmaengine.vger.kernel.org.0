Hi Jason

In general your idea of moving pure emulation code to user space 
is a good strategy.

Even when uaccel was under development, one of the options
was to use VFIO as the transport, goal was the same i.e to keep
the user space have one interface. But the needs of generic 
user space application is significantly different from exporting
a more functional device model to guest, which isn't full emulated
device. which is why VFIO didn't make sense for native use.

And when we move things from VFIO which is already established
as a general device model and accepted by multiple VMM's it gives
instant footing without a whole redesign. When we move things from 
VFIO to uaccel to bolt on the functionality like VFIO, I suspect we 
would be moving code/functionality from VFIO to Uaccel. I don't know
what the net gain would be.

IMS is being reworked based on your feedback. And for mdev
since the code is minimal for emulation, and rest are control paths
that need kernel code to deal with.

For mdev, would you agree we can keep the current architecture,
and investigate moving some emulation code to user space (say even for
standard vfio_pci) and then expand scope later.

Cheers
Ashok
