That would seem like a sensible course of action, as losing
the topology information will likely result in problems down
the line.

The parent device would be a PCI device, if I follow you correctly.
It would thus expect to be able to program the MSI the PCI way,
which wouldn't work. So we end-up with this custom MSI domain
that knows about *this* particular family of devices.

I understand that.

Really? So you can't shut a device with a screaming interrupt,
for example, should it become otherwise unresponsive?

This is an x86'ism, I'm afraid. Systems I deal with can mask any
interrupt at the interrupt controller level, MSI or not.

No. As I said above, the interrupt controller is perfectly capable
of masking interrupts on its own, without touching the device.

If masking at the source is the only way to shut the device up,
and assuming that the device provides the expected semantics
(a MSI raised by the device while the interrupt is masked
isn't lost and gets sent when unmasked), that's fair enough.
It's just ugly.

Thanks,
