Right.

And the INTA_IRQCHIP needs INTA_MSI_DOMAIN.
and the UDMA driver actually needs the ringacc.
It goes pretty deep it looks like.

Yep, sadly this is true.

The merge was correct, thank you!

I'll remove the lie for now and fix things up so I will have legal
grounds to put it back.

Tested, thank you again!
