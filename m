I meant to say msi_list will be the list head for the MSI/MSI-X 
descriptors whereas platform_msi_list will be the list head for all the 
platform-msi descriptors.

Hmm yeah makes sense. I will add these details in the next version.

Yeah, will be added in the next version.

So basically, I wanted to differentiate between the existing 
platform-msi interrupts(GEN_PLAT_MSI) and the IMS interrupts.

But sure, I will try to come up with a more sensible name , 
PLATFORM_MSI_STATIC/DYNAMIC perhaps?

Ok, will change this in the next version.

True, this should be an independent change, I will add it as a separate 
patch next time.

Ya, this seems unnecessary, will remove it.

Sigh, I was trying to follow the same spacing scheme as is for the msi 
list above. Will make it readable next time around.

Hmm, so this macro is basically to be be used by the common code(kernel 
IRQ subsystem for instance) to know which list needs to be traversed, 
msi_list or platform_msi_list of a device.

Finding suitable names for macros is clearly my Achilles heel.

You are right. I think this code would have problems if there is 
concurrent access of the struct device. I probably need to impose some 
kind of locking mechanism here if a device supports both MSI-X and 
platform msi.

hmm, will try to ensure sane programming in the next attempt.
