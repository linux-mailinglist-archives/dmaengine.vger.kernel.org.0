"... as we know that the interrupt line is disabled during the execution 
of the handler (and our handler is not shared with another irq)."

That was the point I wanted to be sure about. So if the IRQ handler 
cannot be called twice ensured by architecture neither on single or 
multi CPU systems (SMP or others) I am fine.
Thanks for your response on that. Appreciated.

Because you take the effort to set up hardware and environment again you 
may also test following fixes/improvements from zynqmp driver which 
could then be merged into altera-msgdma driver. Please check yourself:

f2b816a1dfb8 ("dmaengine: zynqmp_dma: Add device_synchronize support")
# Caught by your patchset
#9558cf4ad07e ("dmaengine: zynqmp_dma: fix lockdep warning in tasklet")
# Caught by your patchset
#16ed0ef3e931 ("dmaengine: zynqmp_dma: cleanup after completing all 
descriptors")
# Caught by your patchset - For the altera-msgdma driver it is a real 
fix not an optimization.
#48594dbf793a ("dmaengine: zynqmp_dma: Use list_move_tail instead of 
list_del/list_add_tail")
5ba080aada5e ("dmaengine: zynqmp_dma: Fix race condition in the probe")

Note: If the sequence is applied in reverse order the log would be 
comparable to zynqmp driver's log.

IMHO your patchset could/should be extended by two more patches and 
split into small junks as mentioned. Then history would stay intact to 
be compared to zynqmp driver.

Note: Take care about "Developerâ€™s Certificate of Origin 1.1". IMHO 
"Signed-off-by" tags from the other patches might/must be copied at 
least for most of the patches then, which would make it easier to get it 
into mainline.

Btw, some cosmetic changes could be made in the mainlined driver:
