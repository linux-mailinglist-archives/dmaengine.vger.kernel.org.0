In which case it is valid?

Looking at the commit which added it and I still don't get the point.
If any of the channel is in use then we should not allow the DMA driver
to go away at all.
Imho there should be a function to check if we can proceed with the
.remove of the driver and fail it if any of the channels are in use.

Hrm, base/dd.c __device_release_driver() does not check the .remove's
return value, so it can not fail.

What is expected if the .remove returns with OK but we still have
channels in use?

After the remove all sorts of things got yanked which might makes the
still in use channels cause issues down the road.

I'm curious why it is a good thing to remotely try to support unbind
when the driver is in use.
It is like one wants to support ext4 removal even when your rootfs is ext4.

I think krefing the DMA driver for channel request/release is just fine,
if user wants to break the system we should not assist...
