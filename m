it has been exactly a month ago that I have sent the v2.
Before I send v3 to address Rob's pdma, prefix comment for the binding
document I would like to have some feedback on the rest of the series.

I believe the DMAengine core patches could be applied without the UDMA
driver stack as there is now a clear user and implementation coming up
for the metadata and the cached data reporting.

Lokesh, Tero, Santosh: Can you look at the ringacc driver, please?

Thanks,
