Yes Thomas, for now this may look odd since there is only one device 
using this
IRQ domain. But there will be other devices following suit, hence I have 
added
all the IRQ chip/domain bits in a separate file in drivers/irqchip in 
the next
version of patches. I'll submit the patches shortly and it will be great 
if I
can get more feedback on it.

hmm, I asked the hardware folks and they have informed me that all IMS 
devices
will support per vector masking/pending bit. This will be updated in the 
next SIOV
spec which will be published soon.
