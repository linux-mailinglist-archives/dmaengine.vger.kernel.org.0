Well, this series is for virtualizing idxd device to VMs, instead of supporting
SVA for bare metal processes. idxd implements a hardware-assisted 
mediated device technique called Intel Scalable I/O Virtualization, which
allows each Assignable Device Interface (ADI, e.g. a work queue) tagged 
with an unique PASID to ensure fine-grained DMA isolation when those 
ADIs are assigned to different VMs. For this purpose idxd utilizes the VFIO 
mdev framework and IOMMU aux-domain extension. Bare metal SVA will
be enabled for idxd later by using the general SVA code that you mentioned.
Both paths will co-exist in the end so there is no such case of disabling
DMA/iommu config.

Thanks
