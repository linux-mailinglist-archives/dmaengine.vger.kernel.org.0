I don't think this is a case that fits the overlay model.

We know what the description of the device is (which is what devicetree
is all about), but the device is to be shared between the Linux kernel
and some other entity, such as the firmware or another OS.  The issue
to be resolved is how to describe that the device is to be shared (in
this case exclusively by the kernel _or_ by the other entity at any
given moment), and how to move ownership of the device between the
Linux kernel and the other entity.

In the scenario presented by Zev, it is suggested that a user space
agent will be involved in deciding which entity owns the device and
to tell the Linux kernel when to take ownership of the device (and
presumably when to relinquish ownership, although we haven't seen
the implementation of relinquishing ownership yet).  One could
imagine direct communication between the driver and the other
entity to mediate ownership.  That seems like a driver specific
defined choice to me, though if there are enough different drivers
facing this situation then eventually a shared framework would
make sense.

So to step back and think architecture, it seems to me that the
devicetree needs to specify in the node describing the shared
device that the device must be (1) owned exclusively by either
the Linux kernel or some other entity, with a signalling method
between the Linux kernel and the other entity being defined
(possibly by information in the node or possibly by the definition
of the driver) or (2) actively shared by both the Linux
kernel and the other entity.  Actively shared may or may not be
possible, based on the specific hardware.  For example, if a single
contains some bits controlled by the Linux kernel and other bits
controlled by the other entity, then it can be difficult for one
of the two entities to atomically modify the register in coordination
with the other entity.  Obviously case 1 is much simpler than case 2,
I'm just trying to create a picture of the potential cases.  In a
simpler version of case 2, each entity would have control of their
own set of registers.

Diverging away from the overlay question, to comment on the
"status" property mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I do not
think that a status value of "reserved" is an adequate method
of conveying all of the information needed by the above range
of scenarios.
