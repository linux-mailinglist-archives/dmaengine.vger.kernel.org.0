Add documentation for interrupt message store. This documentation
describes the basics of Interrupt Message Store (IMS), the need to
introduce a new interrupt mechanism, implementation details in the
kernel, driver changes required to support IMS and the general
misconceptions and FAQs associated with IMS.

Currently the only consumer of the newly introduced IMS APIs is
Intel's Data Streaming Accelerator.

+==========================

+
+About this guide
+================
+
+This guide describes the basics of Interrupt Message Store (IMS), the
+need to introduce a new interrupt mechanism, implementation details of
+IMS in the kernel, driver changes required to support IMS and the general
+misconceptions and FAQs associated with IMS.
+
+What is IMS?
+============
+
+Intel has introduced the Scalable I/O virtualization (SIOV)[1] which
+provides a scalable and lightweight approach to hardware assisted I/O
+virtualization by overcoming many of the shortcomings of SR-IOV.
+
+SIOV shares I/O devices at a much finer granularity, the minimal sharable
+resource being the 'Assignable Device Interface' or ADI. Each ADI can
+support multiple interrupt messages and thus, we need a matching scalable
+interrupt mechanism to process these ADI interrupts. Interrupt Message
+Store or IMS is a new interrupt mechanism to meet such a demand.
+
+Why use IMS?
+============
+
+Until now, the maximum number of interrupts a device could support was 2048
+(using MSI-X). With IMS, there is no such restriction. A device can report
+support for SIOV(and hence IMS) to the kernel through the host device
+driver. Alternatively, if the kernel needs a generic way to discover these
+capabilities without host driver dependency, the PCIE Designated Vendor
+specific Extended capability(DVSEC) can be used. ([1]Section 3.7)
+
+IMS is device-specific which means that the programming of the interrupt
+messages (address/data pairs) is done in some device specific way, and not
+by using a standard like PCI. Also, by using IMS, the device is free to
+choose where it wants to store the interrupt messages. This makes IMS
+highly flexible. Some devices may organise IMS as a table in device memory
+(like MSI-X) which can be accessed through one or more memory mapped system
+pages, some device implementations may organise it in a distributed/
+replicated fashion at each of the “engines” in the device (with future
+multi-tile devices) while context based devices (GPUs for instance),
+can have it stored/located in memory (as part of supervisory state of a
+command/context), that the hosting function can fetch and cache on demand
+at the device. Since the number of contexts cannot be determined at boot
+time, there cannot be a standard enumeration of the IMS size during boot.
+In any approach, devices may implement IMS as either one unified storage
+structure or de-centralized per ADI storage structures.
+
+Even though the IMS storage organisation is device-specific, IMS entries
+store and generate interrupts using the same interrupt message address and
+data format as the PCI Express MSI-X table entries, a DWORD size data
+payload and a 64-bit address. Interrupt messages are expected to be
+programmed only by the host driver. All the IMS interrupt messages are
+stored in the remappable format. Hence, if a driver enables IMS, interrupt
+remapping is also enabled by default.
+
+A device can support both MSI-X and IMS entries simultaneously, each being
+used for a different purpose. E.g., MSI-X can be used to report device level
+errors while IMS for software constructed devices created for native or
+guest use.
+
+Implementation of IMS in the kernel
+===================================
+
+The Linux kernel today already provides a generic mechanism to support
+non-PCI compliant MSI interrupts for platform devices (platform-msi.c).
+To support IMS interrupts, we create a new IMS IRQ domain and extend the
+existing infrastructure. Dynamic allocation of IMS vectors is a requirement
+for devices which support Scalable I/O Virtualization. A driver can allocate
+and free vectors not just once during probe (as was the case with MSI/MSI-X)
+but also in the post probe phase where actual demand is available. Thus, a
+new API, platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs_group is introduced which drivers
+using IMS would be able to call multiple times. The vectors allocated each
+time this API is called are associated with a group ID. To free the vectors
+associated with a particular group, the platform_msi_domain_free_irqs_group
+API can be called. The existing drivers using platform-msi infrastructure
+will continue to use the existing alloc (platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs)
+and free (platform_msi_domain_free_irqs) APIs and are assigned a default
+group ID of 0.
+
+Thus, platform-msi.c provides the generic methods which can be used by any
+non-pci MSI interrupt type while the newly created ims-msi.c provides IMS
+specific callbacks that can be used by drivers capable of generating IMS
+interrupts. Intel has introduced data streaming accelerator (DSA)[2] device
+which supports SIOV and thus supports IMS. Currently, only Intel's Data
+Accelerator (idxd) driver is a consumer of this feature.
+
+FAQs and general misconceptions:
+================================
+
+** There were some concerns raised by Thomas Gleixner and Marc Zyngier
+during Linux plumbers conference 2019:
+
+1. Enumeration of IMS needs to be done by PCI core code and not by
+   individual device drivers:
+
+   Currently, if the kernel needs a generic way to discover IMS capability
+   without host driver dependency, the PCIE Designated Vendor specific
+
+   However, we cannot have a standard way of enumerating the IMS size
+   because for context based devices, the interrupt message is part of
+   the context itself which is managed entirely by the driver. Since
+   context creation is done on demand, there is no way to tell during boot
+   time, the maximum number of contexts (and hence the number of interrupt
+   messages)that the device can support.
+
+   Also, this seems redundant (given only the driver will use this
+   information). Hence, we thought it may suffice to enumerate it as part
+   of driver callback interfaces. In the current linux code, even with
+   MSI-X, the size reported by MSI-X capability is used only to cross check
+   if the driver is asking more than that or not (and if so, fail the call).
+
+   Although, if you believe it would be useful, we can add the IMS size
+   enumeration to the SIOV DVSEC capability.
+
+   Perhaps there is a misunderstanding on what IMS serves. IMS is not a
+   system-wide interrupt solution which serves all devices; it is a
+   self-serving device level interrupt mechanism (other than using system
+   vector resources). Since both producer and consumer of IMS belong to
+   the same device driver, there wouldn't be any ordering problem. Whereas,
+   if IMS service is provided by one driver which serves multiple drivers,
+   there would be ordering problems to solve.
+
+Some other commonly asked questions about IMS are as follows:
+
+1. Does all SIOV devices support MSI-X (even if they have IMS)?
+
+   Yes, all SIOV hosting functions are expected to have MSI-X capability
+   (irrespective of whether it supports IMS or not). This is done for
+   compatibility reasons, because a SIOV hosting function can be used
+   without enabling any SIOV capabilities as a standard PCIe PF.
+
+2. Why is Intel designing a new interrupt mechanism rather than extending
+   MSI-X to address its limitations? Isn't 2048 device interrupts enough?
+
+   MSI-X has a rigid definition of one-table and on-device storage and does
+   not provide the full flexibility required for future multi-tile
+   accelerator designs.
+   IMS was envisioned to be used with large number of ADIs in devices where
+   each will need unique interrupt resources. For example, a DSA shared
+   work queue can support large number of clients where each client can
+   have its own interrupt. In future, with user interrupts, we expect the
+   demand for messages to increase further.
+
+3. Will there be devices which only support IMS in the future?
+
+   No. All Scalable IOV devices will support MSI-X. But the number of MSI-X
+   table entries may be limited compared to number of IMS entries. Device
+   designs can restrict the number of interrupt messages supported with
+   MSI-X (e.g., support only what is required for the base PF function
+   without SIOV), and offer the interrupt message scalability only through
+   IMS. For e.g., DSA supports only 9 messages with MSI-X and 2K messages
+   with IMS.
+
+Device Driver Changes:
+=====================
+
+1. platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs_group (struct device *dev, unsigned int
+   nvec, const struct platform_msi_ops *platform_ops, int *group_id)
+   to allocate IMS interrupts, where:
+
+   dev: The device for which to allocate interrupts
+   nvec: The number of interrupts to allocate
+   platform_ops: Callbacks for platform MSI ops (to be provided by driver)
+   group_id: returned by the call, to be used to free IRQs of a certain type
+
+   eg: static struct platform_msi_ops ims_ops  = {
+        .irq_mask               = ims_irq_mask,
+        .irq_unmask             = ims_irq_unmask,
+        .write_msg              = ims_write_msg,
+        };
+
+        int group;
+        platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs_group (dev, nvec, platform_ops, &group)
+
+   where, struct platform_msi_ops:
+   irq_mask:   mask an interrupt source
+   irq_unmask: unmask an interrupt source
+   irq_write_msi_msg: write message content
+
+   This API can be called multiple times. Every time a new group will be
+   associated with the allocated vectors. Group ID starts from 0.
+
+2. platform_msi_domain_free_irqs_group(struct device *dev, int group) to
+   free IMS interrupts from a particular group
+
+3. To traverse the msi_descs associated with a group:
+        struct device *device;
+        struct msi_desc *desc;
+        struct platform_msi_group_entry *platform_msi_group;
+        int group;
+
+        for_each_platform_msi_entry_in_group(desc, platform_msi_group, group, dev) {
+        }
