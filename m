I'm having a hard time following the technical cruxes of this debate.
I grokked your feedback on the original IMS proposal way back at the
beginning of this effort (pre-COVID even!), so maybe I can mediate
here as well. Although, SIOV is that much harder for me to spell than
IMS, so bear with me.

This part I think I understand, i.e. why spend any logic emulating IMS
as MSI since the IMS capability can be a paravirtualized interface
from guest to VMM with none of the compromises that MSI would enforce.
Did I get that right?

I confess I don't quite understand the shape of what "platform needs
to handle this globally" means, but I understand the desired end
result of "no emulation added where not needed". However, would this
mean that the bare-metal idxd driver can not be used directly in the
guest without modification? For example, as I understand from talking
to Ashok, idxd has some device events like error notification hard
wired to MSI while data patch interrupts are IMS. So even if the IMS
side does not hook up MSI emulation doesn't idxd still need MSI
emulation to reuse the bare metal driver directly?

Where does the collision happen between what you need for a clean
implementation of an IMS-like capability (/me misses his "dev-msi"
name that got thrown out in the Thomas rewrite), and emulation needed
to not have VF special casing in the idxd driver.

Also feel free to straighten me out (Jason or Ashok) if I've botched
the understanding of this.
