Oh right, Runtime PM for DMA channels.

As several DMA calls can be made from atomic context, probably the API
should be split in a non-atomic and an atomic part, cfr. the difference
between clk_prepare() and clk_enable().  Still, DMA slave drivers would need
to be modified, to call the "prepare" to make use of this...
