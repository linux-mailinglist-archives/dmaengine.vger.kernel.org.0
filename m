Not randomly put there Jason :-).. There is a good reason for it. I'm sure
Dave must have responded already. ENQCMD for DSA has the interrupt handle
on which the notification should be sent. Since the data from from user
space HW will verify if the PASID for IMS entry matches what is there in
the descriptor. 

Check description in section 9.2.2.1 of the DSA specification, when PASID
enable is 1, this field is checked against the PASID field of the
descriptor. Also check Section 5.4 and Interrupt Virtualization 7.3.3 for
more info.

Correct, the purpose is not to send PASID prefix for interrupt tranactions.

Where do you see the ioread? I suppose idxd driver will fill in from the
aux_domain default PASID. Not reading from the device IMS entry.

Sorry, I don't follow you on this.. you mean context in hardware or user
context that holds interrupt addr/data values?
