This is what I imagined, this list will be forever, and this worries me.

I don't know if it is true or not, but guess that at least Oracle and
Microsoft bare metal devices and VMs will have same DMI_SYS_VENDOR.

It means that this on_bare_metal() function won't work reliably in many
cases. Also being part of include/linux/msi.h, at some point of time,
this function will be picked by the users outside for the non-IMS cases.

I didn't even mention custom forks of QEMU which are prohibited to change
DMI_SYS_VENDOR and private clouds with custom solutions.

The current array makes DMI_SYS_VENDOR interface as some sort of ABI. If in the future,
the QEMU will decide to use more hipster name, for example "qEmU", this function
won't work.

I'm aware that DMI_SYS_VENDOR is used heavily in the kernel code and
various names for the same company are good example how not reliable it.

The most hilarious example is "Dell/Dell Inc./Dell Inc/Dell Computer Corporation/Dell Computer",
but other companies are not far from them.

Luckily enough, this identification is used for hardware product that
was released to the market and their name will be stable for that
specific model. It is not the case here where we need to ensure future
compatibility too (old kernel on new VM emulator).

I'm not in position to say yes or no to this patch and don't have plans to do it.
Just expressing my feeling that this solution is too hacky for my taste.

Thanks
