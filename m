Sure, hardcoding is never good ;)

Looking at the drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.c for the
TEGRA*_FIFO_CTRL_DEFAULT definition it is still not clear where the
remote FIFO size would fit.
There are fields for overflow and starvation(?) thresholds and TX/RX
size (assuming word length, 3 == 32bits?).
Both threshold is set to one, so I assume currently ADMA is
pushing/pulling data word by word.

Not sure what the burst size is used for, my guess would be that it is
used on the memory (DDR) side for optimized, more efficient accesses?

My guess is that the threshold values are the counter limits, if the DMA
request counter reaches it then ADMA would do a threshold limit worth of
push/pull to ADMAIF.
Or there is another register where the remote FIFO size can be written
and ADMA is counting back from there until it reaches the threshold (and
pushes/pulling again threshold amount of data) so it keeps the FIFO
filled with at least threshold amount of data?

I think in both cases the threshold would be the maxburst.

I suppose you have the patch for adma on how to use the fifo_size
parameter? That would help understand what you are trying to achieve better.
