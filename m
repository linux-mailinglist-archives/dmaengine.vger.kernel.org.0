The case with the 'stuck' descriptor is not really a stuck descriptor.
It is the cyclic descriptor which is by principle never completes so the
vchan_complete() would be never called for it -> we leaked descriptors
in audio start/stop/start/...

Printing about it up is like printing before each vc->desc_free() call
at each completion.

The only case I can think when it is usable is when client prepared
several transfers, but decides to terminate the channel, or if several
descriptors are in the issued list waiting and the client terminates the
channel.

Enabling the debug for all free operation would easily make the device
overwhelmed with prints during boot (MMC rootfs w/ system DMA?).

I'm questioning the sole usefulness of the print. I don't think it adds
any value or information.

That would be a bad idea. imho.

I would just drop the debug print ;)
