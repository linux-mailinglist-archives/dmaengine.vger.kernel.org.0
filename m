I see, so the CPSW will be probed in a similar way as USB peripherals
for example? The CPSW does not have a DT entry at all? Is this correct?

How does the driver knows how to request a DMA resource from the remote
core? How that scales with different SoCs and even with changes in the
firmware?

You are right, this is in a grey area. The DMA channel as it is
controlled by the remote processor, it lends a thread to clients on
other cores (like Linux) via RPMsg.
Well, it is similar to how non DT is working in a way.

This CPSW type is not yet supported mainline, right?
