Let's wait and see what that code looks like and figure it out then.
We can always move it to the PCI core if it turns out to be generic.

Right now the code only finds a capability and checks a bit in it.
None of that is anything the PCI core is interested in.

I'm a little dubious about code that checks whether support is present
but doesn't actually *do* anything with that support, but as long as
it's outside the PCI core, that's up to you :)
