hmm yeah, we changed most of the code after getting a lot of feedback 
from you and folks at plumbers. But yes, I should have replied to all 
the feedback, lesson learnt :)

 From your comments so far, I think your requirement is a subset of what 
IMS is trying to do.

What you want:
have a dynamic means of allocating platform-msi interrupts

On top of this IMS has a requirement that all of the interrupts should 
be remapped.

So we can have tiered code: generic dynamic platform-msi infrastructure
and add the IMS specific bits (Intel specific) on top of this.

The generic code will have no reference to IMS.

cool, so I will hope that you can test out the generic APIs from the ARM 
side!
