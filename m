I would say that the first two patch is a fix:
TX completion check is fixing the performance hit by the early TX
completion workaround which used jiffies+work.

The second patch is fixing a case when we have stale data during RX and
no active transfer. For example when UART reads 1000 bytes, but the
other end is 'streaming' the data and after the 1000 bytes the UART+PDMA
receives data.
Recovering from this state is not easy and it might not even succeed in
HW level.

The last two is I agree, it is not fixing much, it does corrects the
slave_sg TR setup (and improves the cyclic as well).
With that I could send the ASoC platform wrapper for UDMA with
period_bytes_max = 4.2GB ;)
I have SZ_512K in there atm, with the old calculation SZ_64K is the
maximum, not a big issue.

I think the first two patch is a fix candidate as they fix regression
(albeit regression between the series's) and a real world channel lockup
discovered too late for the initial driver.
