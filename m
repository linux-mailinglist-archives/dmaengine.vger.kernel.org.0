OK, I'll go ahead and implement the PSI-L thread representation to the
kernel.

In this DMA for RX (DEV_TO_MEM) we need the source thread paired to
UDMAP receive channel to get data flowing.
The arriving packets within PSI-L are directed by flowID to a specific
receive flow configuration which describe the ring from where UDMAP
should pick up the descriptor and to where the completed one should be
placed for the SW.

There are cases when Linux for example does not have access to the
receive channel at all, it is handled by another core, but certain
receive flow(s) are given to Linux so they can receive packets.
In this case we do RX DMA without actual DMA channel.
