The channel can be either Packet or TR mode. The HW is really flexible
on this (and on other things as well).
It just happens that Linux need to use specific channels in a specific mode.

Would it help if we assume that all channels are used in Packet mode,
but we have linux,tr-mode bool to indicate that the given channel in
Linux need to be used in TR mode.

So I should have a table for the thread IDs in the DMA driver and mark
channels as TR or Packet in there for Linux use?
Or just an array which would mark the non packet PSI-L thread IDs?

I still prefer to have this coming via DT as a Linux parameter as other
OS is free to ignore the linux,udma-mode, but as I said there are
certain channels which must be used in Linux in certain mode while
others in different mode.

This is UDMAP internal information on what type of Descriptors the
channel will expect and how it is going to dispatch the work.

Packet and TR mode at the end does the same thing, but in a completely
different way.
