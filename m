ok, i will create a per device irq chip which will directly have the 
device specific callbacks instead of another layer of redirection.

This way i will get rid of the 'platform_msi_ops' data structure.

I am not sure what you mean by device specific resource management, are 
you referring to dev_msi_alloc/free_irqs?

yeah i think most of the msi_domain_ops (msi_prepare, set_desc etc) are 
common and can be moved into a common file.

This is one part I didn't understand.

Currently my dev_msi_alloc_irqs is simply a wrapper over 
platform_msi_domain_alloc_irqs which again mostly calls 
msi_domain_alloc_irqs.

When you say add a .alloc, .free, does this mean we should add a device 
specific alloc/free and not use the default 
msi_domain_alloc/msi_domain_free?

I don't see anything device specific to be done for IDXD atleast, can 
you please let me know?

yeah, so I will create the IRQ domain in the IDXD driver with INTEL-IR

Thanks for giving such a detailed explanation! really helps :)

hmmm, again I am not sure of which extra allocation layer you are

 From your explanation:


In the device driver:


static const struct irq_domain_ops idxd_irq_domain_ops = {

.alloc= idxd_domain_alloc, //not sure what this should do

.free= idxd_domain_free,

};

struct irq_chip idxd_irq_chip = {

.name= "idxd"

.irq_mask= idxd_irq_mask,

.irq_unmask= idxd_irq_unmask,

.irq_write_msg = idxd_irq_write_msg,

.irq_ack= irq_chip_ack_parent,

.irq_retrigger= irq_chip_retrigger_hierarchy,

.flags= IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE,

}

struct msi_domain_info idxd_domain_info = {

.flags        =MSI_FLAG_USE_DEF_DOM_OPS | MSI_FLAG_USE_DEF_CHIP_OPS,

.ops          =&dev_msi_domain_ops,//can be common

.chip         =&idxd_irq_chip //per device

.handler= handle_edge_irq,

.handler_name = "edge",

}

dev->msi_domain = dev_msi_create_irq_domain(iommu->ir_domain, 
idxd_domain_info, idxd_irq_domain_ops)

msi_domain_alloc_irqs(dev->msi_domain, dev, nvec);

Common code:


struct irq_domain *dev_msi_create_irq_domain(struct irq_domain *parent,

struct msi_domain_info *dev_msi_domain_info,

struct irq_domain_ops dev_msi_irq_domain_ops)

{

struct irq_domain *domain;

         .......

domain = irq_domain_create_hierarchy(parent, IRQ_DOMAIN_FLAG_MSI, 0,
NULL, &dev_msi_irq_domain_ops, info);

         .......

return domain;

}

static struct msi_domain_ops dev_msi_domain_ops = {

.set_desc= dev_msi_set_desc,

.msi_prepare= dev_msi_prepare,

.get_hwirq= dev_msi_get_hwirq,

}; // can re-use platform-msi data structures


except the alloc/free irq_domain_ops, does this look fine to you?
