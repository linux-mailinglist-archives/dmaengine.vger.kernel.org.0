OK, I can not argue with that.
I'll have 'tr-mode' bool to indicate that the channel should be
configured in TR mode for the given thread.

We have certain peripherals (McASP/UART/McSPI/etc) which is serviced by
PDMAs to be compatible with the data movement architecture implemented
within NAVSS.
Unlike native peripherals, like networking we can configure the UDMAP
channel to either Packet or TR mode. There are differences between the
two modes, but the job can be done in both modes.
In Linux we use TR mode for audio channels as it provides the needed
functionality we need (efficient cyclic mode, can disable interrupts).

There is no information from the HW on how a given thread is best used
and other OSs can opt for not optimal use.

But the majority of threads are better served in Packet mode, so adding
a bool flag to the thread configuration to indicate that TR mode is the
advised mode for it is perfectly fine.
