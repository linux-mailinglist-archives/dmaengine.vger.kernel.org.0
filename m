We have the bind/unbind ability today, from userspace, that can control
this.  Why not just have Linux grab the device when it boots, and then
when userspace wants to "give the device up", it writes to "unbind" in
sysfs, and then when all is done, it writes to the "bind" file and then
Linux takes back over.

Unless for some reason Linux should _not_ grab the device when booting,
then things get messier, as we have seen in this thread.
