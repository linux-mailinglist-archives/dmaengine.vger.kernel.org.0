I see couple of issues with DMA usage by McASP/sound:

McASP TX FIFO events are disabled first and then DMA channel is stopped.
This does not work for K3 SoCs as some data remains stuck in DMA pipe
and channel never goes to disable state.

I see .stop_dma_first flag in snd_soc_dai_link to force DMA to be
stopped first, but I am not quite familiar on where to set this flag?
Even so, snd_dmaengine_pcm_trigger() calls dmaengine_terminate_async()
and does not call dmaengine_synchronize() before disabling McASP TX, so
channel teardown would still be unsuccessful.

Alternately, we could reduce dev_warn() in udma_synchronize() to
dev_dbg() as channel is still recoverable via  udma_reset_chan() which
is done immediately after.
There is a further dev_warn() message to indicate if channel refused to
stop even after a reset?
