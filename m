On Apple SoCs the ADMAC peripheral shares a reset line with another
audio-related peripheral which is the MCA.

On the side of the MCA, the reset is described in binding (staged in
broonie-sound/for-6.1) and in the soon-to-be-merged series adding new
nodes to t8103/t600x SoC device trees [1]. The staged MCA driver does
make use of the reset, knowing it's a shared one.

This series catches up on the ADMAC side, adds the reset to the binding
and describes it in the t8103/t600x DTs (on top of [1]). It also pulls
the shared reset from the driver.

Since [1] already includes another ADMAC binding change and will
probably be fully merged into Hector's asahi-soc tree, I propose the
binding change here takes the same route. Leaving patches #3 and #4 to
go into dmaengine.
